## Project Title
Opensea Clone


## Project Description
1.   This is a replicate/clone of the popular (https://opensea.io/) website.
2.   Tools and Libraries used in the cause of building this  project.
    [React]
    [Sass]/[CSS]
    [react-icons]. there are two factors which influenced the usage of the aboved mentioned tools/library.

-   This was the projects requirements and secondly
-   I have used them in them past so I am confortable using them, REACT is a great UI library and SASS is also a great CSS-preprosessor.

3.   According to the way and manner I structured the project, I grouped the project into sections. for instance,
    let me explain, there is a folder called `containers` inside the `src` folder, that is where my grouped sections
    of the page are located.
        And also I grouped reuseable single components inside of the `components` folder, nested inside of the `src` folder,
    which can be reused in the `containers` folder. the folders/files in the `containers` are named for easy understanding. check it out.

4.  At the time of writing this markdown file, some of the page sections are yet to be incorperated, but hopefully there will be added
    before this get to you.
